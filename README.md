Tic-Tac-Toe

Description: Tic-Tac-Toe is a simplistic game created for 2 players.  This game was created during the time of 1300 BCE and is played on a 3 x 3 board. One player uses the symbol X, while the opposing player uses the Symbol O.  These players challenge against one another in order to get 3 in a row.

How To Play: You would start the game and a board will be displayed in the console.  You would type a number between 1 through 9 in the console to select the position you would like to place your symbol.  Player's objective of the game is to obtain 3 in a row diagonally, vertically, or horrizontally.  If no one can win, the best move is to draw.
